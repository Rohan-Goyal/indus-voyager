  abstractNote = {This thesis takes a closer look at the complex maneuver known
                  as gravity assist, a popular method of interplanetary travel.
                  The maneuver is used to gain or lose momentum by flying by
                  planets, which induces a speed and direction change. A
                  simulation model is created using the General Mission Analysis
                  Tool (GMAT), which is intended to be easily reproduced and
                  altered to match any desired gravity assist maneuver. The
                  validity of its results is analyzed, comparing them to
                  available data from real missions. Some parameters, including
                  speed and trajectory, are found to be extremely reliable. The
                  model is then used as a tool to investigate the way that
                  different parameters impact this complex environment, and the
                  advantages of performing thrusting burns at different points
                  during the maneuver are explored. According to theory,
                  thrusting at the point of closest approach to the planet is
                  thought to be the most efficient method for changing speed and
                  direction of flight. However, the results from this study show
                  that thrusting before this point can have some major
                  advantages, depending on the desired outcome. The reason
                  behind this is concluded to be the high sensitivity of the
                  gravity assist maneuver to the altitude and location of the
                  point of closest approach.},

                  Neptune{\textquoteright}s magnetic field is highly tilted and
                  offset from the planet{\textquoteright}s center; it rotates
                  with a period of 16.11 hours. Two narrow and two broad rings
                  circle the planet; the outermost of these rings has three
                  optically thicker arc segments. Six new moons were discovered
